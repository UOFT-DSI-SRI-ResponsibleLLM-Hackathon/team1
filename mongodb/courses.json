This movement of food gives rise to new \u2018foodways\u2019 to help us to understand the past in terms of temporally connected sites of intense interaction. Food also plays a strong role in shaping translocal identities. As peoples have moved in the world, food has played a central role in (re)defining who they are, reproducing myth and ritual, and bounding diasporic communities. This course seeks to address questions surrounding the dynamics of the food \u2018we\u2019 eat, the ways in which \u2018we\u2019 eat, the meaning \u2018we\u2019 give to eating, and the effect of eating in a transnational world.

The instruments of long-distance trade, like insurance, credit and debt, connected cities and continents in new and sometimes unsettling ways. The free movement of goods and cash was mirrored by restrictions on migration to some parts of the world and by forced or coerced migration to others.

We consider the international phenomenon of migrant domestic labour and how it shapes social and family relations, both in countries of origin such as the Philippines and Ethiopia, as well as in countries of employment such as Canada and Lebanon. But we also reflect on how migration radically transforms life inside the home, affecting what it means to be a parent, a child, or a partner.

Netherlandish sculptors created the tombs of northern European rulers, defining their public identity in the communal space of church and chapel. Miniature carved altarpieces helped guide modes of private devotion and were widely imitated from Italy to Scandinavia. Netherlandish tapestries broadcast the heroic deeds of the Caesars and the patriarchs in the palaces of kings and high nobles as prototypes for their reigns. We will examine the rise of the Renaissance manner in northern Europe, the role of the religious arts, the ideology of urban culture, the consequences of the Reformation and iconoclasm, the functions of various species of portraiture, and the particular properties of different media, while dedicating much attention to Bosch and Bruegel.

Since international competitiveness of industrialized economies cannot be based on cost advantages alone, future growth in the knowledge-based economy will be increasingly associated with capabilities related to creativity, knowledge generation and innovation. As a consequence, questions regarding the performance in innovation and effectiveness of policy support become decisive at the firm level, regional level and national level. The first part of the course deals with conceptual foundations of innovation processes, such as evolutionary and institutional views of innovation.

As a result, regional economic change has been very difficult to fully explain (and certainly predict) using conventional (orthodox) theories and methods. This course examines the theoretical linkage between related trends in terms of globalization, vertical disintegration, specialization, innovation, and the locational behaviour of firms. We will focus on the seemingly counter-intuitive finding that regional economic change in a time of increasing global interdependence is increasingly dependent on the local context. Topics will include evolutionary economic geography, path dependence, economic clusters, learning regions, the role of institutions, knowledge spill-overs, and the geography of innovation, among others.

We study how people who lived more than a thousand years before our time transported ideas, products, and scripts by land and sea via routes that connected large parts of Africa, Central & South Asia, and East and Southeast Asia, and their histories. The land and sea routes connected these communities and the cosmopolitan outlook of the hosts provided the contingent conditions for a Buddhist monks to travel from all over China to Southern and Southeast Asia; Muslim scholars to travel from West Africa to Indonesia; and merchants and writers to move within these worlds. Human migration, economic trade, and religious conversion had linked the lands and the seas, making it possible for our imams, merchants, monks, and servants to traverse these territories, across the Africa and Asia. This vibrant and wealthy world of African and Asian thinkers, merchants, leaders, and communities became the envy of the world, and as late as the seventeenth century, these crazy rich Africans and Asians dominated the world as it was known.

In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra), and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory), considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology), or as the Grothendieck group. Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.) The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.) The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.

Situated squarely within the study of religion, this course considers how different traditions from around the world and for thousands of years have raised similar questions about happiness\u2014not simply for the sake of reflection but also to do something about it. And their answers have varied: fast, meditate, pray, go to the desert, come together, get high, suffer, renounce God, and/or make lots of money.

Finally, we analyze how Indigenous communities and culture begin to create \u201cNew Religions\u201d that blend Indigenous values and thinking with aspects of Western culture or emerge in direct response to re-imagining spirituality in attempts to prove humanness and civility in contexts where little of Indigenous culture and values has been seen as acceptable."}, {"title": "Judaism", "code": "RLG202H1", "description": "An introduction to the religious tradition of the Jews that explores key themes as they change from ancient times to today.

Common to these and other religious beliefs is that they lack empirical evidence to support them \u2013 at least so say religious skeptics. They insist that rational beliefs require justification and that justification comes from perceptions anyone could have or solid scientific reasoning. Anyone who harbors religious beliefs thus violates a basic epistemic responsibility. How might people who hold \u2013 and want to continue to hold \u2013 religious beliefs respond to these accusations and doubts? The course examines these basic epistemological and moral challenges to religious belief as well as the various strategies available to religious believers who are confronted with such demands for justifications.

Racist, sexist, and other unconscious fantasies of evil and persecuting \u2018others\u2019 generate social injustice. At the same time, social injustice distorts the mind. This \u201cdual track\u201d process can drive human beings and their societies mad. Justice depends upon transformations of social structures and moral codes as well as changes within human minds. In order for psychoanalysis to realize its own potential for facilitating justice, it must confront its own historical contribution to injustice. Through a close reading of selected texts from Sigmund Freud and the activist psychiatrist Franz Fanon, this course explores the inherent tensions between colonizing and emancipatory themes within psychoanalytic discourses. Both Freud and Fanon contribute to a psychoanalytic critical theory that have influenced several contemporary ethnographic writers who explore the intricate ways in which social and cultural realities are internalized as unconscious hauntings and tormenting spirits across generations."}, {"title": "Religion and Philosophy in the European Enlightenment", "code": "RLG420H1", "description": "An advanced study of selected Enlightenment thinkers with a focus on their interpretations of religion.

Adorno\u2019s critique of society and the individual is often (mis)interpreted as so ruthlessly pervasive that it forecloses on any possibility for emancipatory transformation.

This critical approach is expected to offer a deeper investigation of Asia in and of itself while critiquing dominant assumptions and frameworks found in existing approaches to Asia."}, {"title": "Deconstructing 'Muslim American' - Race, Nationalism, and Religion", "code": "SOC373H1", "description": "Since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Muslim Americans have once again been cast as both threatening \u201coutsiders\u201d as well as examples of what makes the United States a \u201cnation of immigrants.\u201d What do these contestations teach us about how race, nationalism, and globalization shape immigrant identities? Taking Muslim Americans as a case study, this course will examine a range of topics, from everyday boundary-making to ongoing global politics pertaining to different Muslim groups in the United States, often drawing comparison with Muslims in other Western countries. More broadly, the course aims to unpack how various global and local/national forces shape the contours, dimensions, and meanings attached to an identity category. To that end, the course begins with some prominent sociological theories, such as intersectionality, double-consciousness, and Orientalism. We will apply these theoretical lenses to analyze issues of race, globalization, cultural citizenship, media representation, and political integration in Muslim American and immigrant experiences."}, {"title": "Sociology of the City", "code": "SOC375H1", "description": "Cities have played a vital role in the global economy, but within the past decade, their importance has increased. From issues of housing affordability to homelessness, from debt crises to energy usage, from insufficient water to the outbreak of diseases, name a problem that concerns any aspect of social life, and the city is the crucible of where you will find it. On the other hand, cities represent our best hope for finding solutions to these enormous problems since they also serve as incubators of innovation, ideas and wealth creation. It is for these reasons that understanding cities become an important frame for understanding the joys and perils of social life. For over a century, sociologists have focused on understanding different issues related to cities and their urbanization processes. However, in investigating the city, there have been several debates about their futures."}, {"title": "Sociology of Hip Hop", "code": "SOC380H1", "description": "This course will use the rivalry between rappers Notorious B.I.G.

Do they lead to reform, used for new professional mobilization, new forms of regulation and oversight, targeted for legal intervention, or do they generate new political shifts, or new memories or narratives? Or are they ignored?
