        "content": "As a first-year undergraduate CS student at the University of Toronto, you'll have the opportunity to take a variety of courses that will introduce you to the basics of computer science. Here are some recommendations for first-year courses:\n\n**Compulsory Courses:**\n\n1. COMP 101: Introduction to Computer Science (I) - a survey of computer science, covering topics like algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts.\n2. COMP 110: Computer Science Fundamentals (I) - an introductory course on the basics of computer science, including programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.\n3. MATH 122: Calculus for Computer Science (I) - a calculus course that focuses on the mathematical concepts required for computer science, including limits, derivatives, and integrals.\n\n**Recommended Courses:**\n\n1. CSE 100: Problem-Solving Skills for Computer Science - a course that helps you develop problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and collaboration.\n2. CSE 103: Digital Logic - a course that introduces you to digital logic, covering topics like Boolean algebra, logic gates, and digital circuits.\n3. MATH 137: Calculus 100A (or MATH 123) - an additional calculus course that covers more advanced topics like vector calculus and differential equations.\n\n**Electives:**\n\n1. CSE 105: Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Computer Science - a course that introduces you to probability and statistics, covering topics like probability theory, statistical analysis, and data interpretation.\n2.
