But I'm sure I can help you navigate here at Rotman Commerce, even if I'm not a CS student.\n\nFor computer science students like you, I always recommend taking the Computer Science's Data Structures and Algorithm course in CO 120 (Data Structures and Algorithms) so it's perfect to check it out. I've had friends in CS and they've all taken that course and loved it. Don't forget to also take the CS course for \"Computer Based System\" too.\n\nOn another note, our campus has an incredible Computer Science club, which is a fantastic resource for getting involved in tech-related projects and events. You might want to check that out!\n\nHowever, I have to say that I'm more familiar with the Commerce side of things, so if you'd like any advice or help on course selection or anything related to Rotman Commerce, just let me know and I'd be happy to share my knowledge!"
